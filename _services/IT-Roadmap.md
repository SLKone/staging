intro: SLKone helps organizations define their IT roadmap by reviewing and prioritizing technology gaps, evaluating solutions, and providing integration blueprints. We believe deeply in evaluating gaps and aligning those gaps to activities to ensure systems support processes to maximize the impact of any digital initiative. Moreover, we evaluate the organization’s data maturity along the data lifecycle (gathering, management, processing, and accessibility) to determine if today’s data means tomorrow’s insight.
