intro: The right operating model can mean the difference between success and failure. SLKoneâ€™s approach to operating model design can take many shapes, ranging from a narrow functional focus to a holistic perspective addressing the entire business. No matter the size and scope of a transformation, all projects have some commonality; they will impact (and hopefully adequately address) People, Processes, and Technology.  Our approach seeks to ensure roles are clear, interactions are easily enabled and organizations are focused on activities that drive enterprise value.
