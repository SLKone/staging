intro: Automation can be simple, intelligent, or cognitive and selecting a level of automation that fits the constraints of the environment, which is appropriate for the activity being automated, will reduce costs and increase the return from the project. We have seen this type of result in ambitious automation and advanced analytics goals, and investment dollars follow. But desire alone is not enough to provide the environment required to make these goals pay dividends to the organization. We evaluate process and data maturity to value automation opportunities and deploy robust project management processes to ensure on-time and on-cost delivery.
