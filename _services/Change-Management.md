intro: The amount of change, which can manifest as organizational disruption, determines the amount of support necessary for the transition. SLKone helps organizations navigate the new norm through detailed rigor and a culture of accountability. We establish cadences, milestones, and evaluate personnel behavior on an on-going basis, taking note of subtle red flags like meetings not being scheduled, tasks being lost in the shuffle, and individuals acting outside of policy as these may all be signs that additional support is needed.
