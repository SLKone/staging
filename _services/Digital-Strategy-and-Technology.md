intro: "Digital systems have various purposes in business. For the sake of simplicity, we find it most useful to think of systems as supporting activity completion in the following ways: making activities easier to complete (access and communication of information), as a tool for completing activities, and performing activities. Through one of these three uses, our goal is to drive performance in an organization by reducing the time to complete any given activity, improve the consistency of an output, or lower the cost of labor required to perform the activity."
