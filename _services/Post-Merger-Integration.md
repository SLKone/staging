intro: SLKone assesses and plans the needs of each integration based on the size of the transaction, the complexity of the processes within the businesses, the nature of the transaction (stock vs. asset, friendly vs. takeover, etc.), and/or the amount of change anticipated through the integration of people, processes, and systems. Our disciplined approach to project management ensures results with minimal disruption to the business.
