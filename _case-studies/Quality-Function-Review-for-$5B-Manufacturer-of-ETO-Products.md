#### Situation
- The client manufactured a diverse portfolio of Make To Order (MTO)  and ETO products serving the Oil & Gas industry​
- After experiencing a number of costly escapes while simultaneously facing increasing costs in the quality function, the organization set out to conduct a review of the Quality organization​
- **SLKone was hired to perform the review and identified several key opportunities**;​
    -  Headcount was over twice the level reported​
    -  Key gaps in quality reporting lines (Supplier to Control)​
    -  Mis-aligned roles and responsibilities

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Key users of Quality resources were interviewed and surveyed as to current projects and uses​
- Quality resources were identified, reviewed and classified, including outside of Quality based on the core competencies of personnel​
- Reporting lines were re-aligned and processes and interactions documented to ensure connectivity, especially between Quality Control and Supplier Quality​
- Additional pain points and opportunities were identified to better utilize Quality resources, including; co-located Non-Destructive Testing labs, digitization of quality   documentation, utilization of common Quality Management System

#### Leading With Results
- **60% reduction in identified escapes**; Escapes, that had largely been driven by supplier issues, quickly resolved through a combination of rejected orders and open communication internally and externally with vendors​
- **Over 50% reduction in Quality Compensation & Benefits spend**; Addressed excessive management personnel and through a re-allocation of responsibilities and initial digitization efforts reduced the need for Quality resources
