#### Situation
- A leading provider-practice network of specialty healthcare was entering into a merger with an equal sized competitor in the space
- The executive leader, and practicing physician, had never experienced a merger of this magnitude previously
- Critical strategic decisions needed to be made as part of the integration and to set the organization up for continued success
- The integration process was anticipated to take several months and included critical milestones and decision points

#### Bespoke Solutions
- As an addition to the integration support provided to the organization, a key member of SLKone provided executive coaching to the leader
- Multiple tools and approaches were leveraged to enable the leader to objectively analyze situations, reflect on the desired outcomes, and make decisions
- The one-on-one coaching continued for multiple months to ensure the leader was able to confidently continue to deliver results

#### Leading With Results
- **Delivered a bespoke approach:** SLKone tailored the approach to coaching to what fit with the executive’s schedule and approach
- **Provided tools to lead to successes:** Specific tools and methodologies were developed and leveraged with the leader, enabling the leader to build their own skill set for future scenarios
- **Exceeded goals by 100%:** The initial goals of the integration and plans for the organization were exceeded by over 100% of the original targets. The executive attributed much of the organizational success to the approach and decision-making to SLKone’s help
