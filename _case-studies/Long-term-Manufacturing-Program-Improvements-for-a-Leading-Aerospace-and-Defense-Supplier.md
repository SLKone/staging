#### Situation
- A multi-billion dollar aerospace and defense manufacturer suffered from decreasing margins and quality issues on a long-term manufacturing program
- The manufacturing processes were performed on a shared manufacturing cell and were not prioritized due to the production volume
- The program was extended for low-rate production and spare production for an additional ten years which could result in significant profitability impacts

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Members of SLKone led a one-week kaizen improvement project to identify high-impact improvements to the program
- Identified quick-wins and long-term improvements for the program, including benefits for other programs produced on the cell equipment
- A prioritization and program management approach was developed and leveraged to track progress

#### Leading With Results
- **Improvements implemented in half of target timelines:** Improvements identified were implemented within three months of the event, half the time of initial goal timeline
- **Cost reductions of over $5M for the life of the program:** Production and flow improvements for the production cell resulted in over $5M in cost reductions for the duration of the program
- **On-time-delivery improved by 20%:** Scheduling and production process modifications contributed to an on-time-delivery improvement of over 20%
