#### Situation
- The company was planning to re-engineer the supply chain and expand the product portfolio through a series of "tuck-in" acquisitions
- The equity sponsors and management needed a “roadmap” of improvement areas and critical stabilization points to prepare for expansion
- Concurrently, the organization was in the midst of hiring and integrating a new leadership team with the population of long-tenured employees
- Immature record-to-report processes contributed to uncertainty regarding results of the business
- A significant amount of paper-only records existed as a result of historical underinvestment in IT

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Strategized with the incoming leadership to prioritize the largest areas of concern and potential critical breakpoints
- Interviewed team members across key financial, operational, and administrative functions to understand pain points and map an interconnected organization
- Identified and captured quick win – established process for management of Delegation of Authority
- Documented IT Maturity assessment to prioritize key focus areas and identify where IT systems could and could not adequately support planned growth

#### Leading With Results
- **Provided a roadmap** for future improvements and critical path items across the organization
- **Prioritized investment priorities** for the organization as it prepared for immediate expansion
- **Refined the investment realization** timeline for the equity sponsors for the investment and growth trajectory
