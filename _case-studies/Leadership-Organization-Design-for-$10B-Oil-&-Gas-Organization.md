#### Situation
- In preparation for a significant business event the management team felt a need to re-align their leadership team.​
- The business leader had a significant number of direct reports and as a result limited the agility and responsiveness of the business​
- Similarly, the business’ end market had been shifting towards a solution vs product market, requiring coordination, planning and engineering across business units​
- **SLKone was brought on board to assist the management team design and implement the new organizational structure, including defining roles, responsibilities, activities and interactions**

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone assessed the current state environment as well as the future requirements of the business, with respect to the pending business event​
- Several scenarios were developed covering a range of potential designs, from low degree of change to high   ​
- Decision facilitation session was performed to review organizational Key Performance Indicators, pros and cons​
- In a collaborative approach, Roles & Responsibilities as well as key interactions were defined and documented​
- A transition plan was developed;  training was conducted on the new structure

#### Leading With Results
- **Reduced CEO direct reports by 50%**  by consolidating business unit reporting lines along the lines of customer buying structures ​
- **Time conducting business performance review meetings was reduced by ~16,000 man hours per year** through the simplification of the matrix reporting structure within the business
