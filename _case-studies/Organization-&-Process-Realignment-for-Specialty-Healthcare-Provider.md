#### Situation
- $200M Equity Owned Specialty Healthcare Provider​
- After completing several acquisitions across varying geographies, the organizational reporting structure was fragmented and lacked the ability to support growth​
- As a result, the organization suffered from a lack of formalized processes and procedures​
- Defined reporting structure and leadership role definitions were required​
- **SLKone was asked to assess, propose, and assist with implementing a revised organizational structure linked to corporate strategy**

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Performance evaluation of key stakeholders were performed to establish a baseline​
- Functional processes were reviewed and analyzed, to be aligned with the future state organization​
- Interviews with N-1 and N-2 leaders were conducted to assess the workload and activities performed by the roles and clarify responsibilities​
- Spans and layers analysis built to identify critical focal areas​
- Built organization structure to align with strategic growth plans and support continual expansion, integrating the healthcare functions as well as enabling functions into the structure

#### Leading With Results
- **Reduced reporting layers by 3 layers** creating direct alignment with strategic incentives​
- **CEO direct reports reduced by over 50%** to better allocate time and focused effort​
- Restructuring of Operational team to create focused effort to drive operational performance​
- Development of core Clinical Advisory Board to ensure clinical decision-making was independent from business decision-making​
- Since implementation, structure has supported two like-sized acquisitions in differing geographic regions
