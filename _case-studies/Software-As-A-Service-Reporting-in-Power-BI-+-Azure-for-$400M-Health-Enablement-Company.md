#### Situation
- Private equity backed $400M health company with global footprint lacked in-depth reports to drive profitable growth​
- Prior to SLKone's engagement, another vendor attempted to develop analytics for the C-Suite but failed to produce meaningful reports after a three-month period​
- Challenges with the data perpetuated by multiple acquisitions and complex sales orders, made automating any reports extremely difficult without a material overhaul of processes and data validation​
- **SLKone was tasked to remediate existing data challenges and develop a full suite of automated reports and dashboards for numerous stakeholders**

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone performed a review of all sales orders in the past 2.5 years to identify inaccuracies and process breakdowns. As a result, over 20 process changes were made, and additional fields added to the sales order workflow​
- Created an Azure cloud database as an intermediary solution to reduce complexity by consolidating numerous data sources and performing Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) steps to merge data​
- Developed automated Power BI reports with drill-through capability from the ‘top floor to shop floor’​
- Calculated complex measures with multitude of constants and variables to recommend over / under investment within product lines

#### Leading With Results
- **Identified and remediated 20+ process gaps** causing sales order inaccuracies resulting in improved billing and reporting capabilities​
- **Integrated three Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and two Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems** on an Azure cloud database, simplifying the ETL process and facilitating the ability of all systems' data to talk to each other​
- **Created 50+ reports within a Power BI dashboard** to provide insights to all aspects of the business
