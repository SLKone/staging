#### Situation
- Engineering and Technology (E&T) department was in transition as it appointed a new leader
- New leader had minimal experience within E&T function and was seeking to identify improvement opportunities
- Limited communication across nine product lines and four Centers of Excellence, which represented the centralized engineering leadership
- Each product line interacted with the central E&T function differently and utilized non-standardized processes

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Interviewed 16 key leaders across all pillars and product lines
- Identified four recurring themes that resonated through the interviews
- Analyzed the structure and determined excessive layers and low spans of control within the engineering function
- Documented the RASCI relationships to achieve key strategic goals identified by function leadership

#### Leading With Results
- **Summarized the cross-functional structure** within the E&T dept. while highlighting differences in mission and **communication gaps**
- **Generated a RASCI to add clarity** to roles and activities across the organization
- **Presented findings** during the E&T offsite
- **Presented three tools** that could immediately be deployed to drive positive change in the E&T dept
