#### Situation
- Leadership identified key initiatives to improve gross margins by reducing the cost to service and internal operating costs to support the work order management process​
- Organization relied on highly manual invoicing process​
- Parts ordering was disconnected from field service management platform​
- Training was deemed to be an improvement opportunity for technicians and back-end administrative personnel​
- **SLKone was asked to execute an assessment of processes and training, identify cost savings opportunities, and support implementation**

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Rapid operational assessment leveraging Celonis process mining software followed by interviews with key stakeholders to confirm opportunities​
- Executed an immersive design thinking approach to understand needs and gaps of the existing training curriculum​
- Worked with finance team to understand invoicing process; discovering highly manual process with data gaps ​
- Identified user-experience issues within the work order and parts ordering process which made training more difficult; training also taught “how the system worked” and not “how to use the system”

#### Leading With Results
- **~$100k in headcount savings** by building a Python based tool to integrate field service and account systems​
- **Reduced time to close Work Order by 44% saving ~$95k in labor** costs by redesigning the Work Order​
- Designed, supported development, trained, and implemented new Parts Order process; **~$60k in licensing cost reduction and improved visibility into parts status across the organization​**
- **Reduced time to place a parts order by 80-90%​**
- Released new training for technicians **improving paperwork first pass yield by ~9.4%**
