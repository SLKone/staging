#### Situation
- Two physician-owned-managed organizations were planning to merge as part of a private equity transaction
- Neither organization had dedicated project management experts, nor experience in mergers and integrations
- The core business processes and success drivers needed to be retained while integrating the two back-office organizations
- Primary integration activities, prioritization and dependencies of activities, and activity owners had not been identified

#### Bespoke Solutions
- The success factors for the two organizations were reviewed and mapped to ensure these were not diluted through the integration
- Primary activities, dependencies, and area owners were identified to develop an integration plan
- A formal, scalable integration management office was implemented to support activities
- Surge capacity and resourcing was integrated to the core-team to provide guidance and additional horsepower

#### Leading With Results
- **Expedited and completed the merger timeline** compared to the expectations of the Sponsors and Management teams
- **Achieved 150% of planned EBITDA** within a year.  The organization was able to reach its financial and profitability targets one-year earlier than planned
- **Successfully merged the organizations and avoided disruption.**  Both organizations were able to functionally integrate and outperform expectations
