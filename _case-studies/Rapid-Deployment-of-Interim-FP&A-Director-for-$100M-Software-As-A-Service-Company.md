#### Situation
- $100M  SaaS company focused on enterprise data management lacked financial and operational Key Performance Indicators ​
- The company consisted of 7 acquisitions that had not undergone a full integration; 2 additional acquisitions would be completed before the final transaction of the client to a new Private Equity sponsor​
- The FP&A leader exited the company without notice; SLKone was on the ground the following week​
- Historic reporting workbooks contained numerous unexplained, ‘hard-coded’ changes in the margins; previous FP&A Director was unavailable to transition or onboard SLKone​
- Newly hired CFO was concerned that FP&A Director’s exit in conjunction with questionable historic reports would terminally impact the ongoing sale process​
- **SLKone was hired to immediately assume all FP&A responsibilities, improve the FP&A capabilities, manage existing staff, and support the sale process**

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Audited existing Sharepoint site in order to (a) locate historic key reports, (b) identify available support, (c) understand existing capabilities​
- Consolidated all historic financial reports into a single workbook; connected that workbook directly to Host Analytics (a cloud-based consolidation tool); vetted and confirmed all ‘hard-codes’ found in margin​
- Developed a partnership with Controllership that had been neglected; led to the improvement of financial reporting, the timeliness of financial reporting, and the creation of operational dashboards​
    - Monthly Recurring Revenue dashboard was made possible by the creative use of financial data maintained in the client’s Enterprise Resource System​
- Actively engaged in the sale process; maintained timely recurring deliverables while providing surge capacity to diligence requests

#### Leading With Results
- **Reduced days to close from 21 to 10 ​**
- Supported the **successful sale at 13x multiple**​
- Managed the existing staff; placed one staffer on Performance Improvement Plan and managed the HR struggle​
