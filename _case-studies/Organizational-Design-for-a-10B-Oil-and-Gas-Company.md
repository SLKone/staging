#### Situation
- The client was a $10B oil and gas company, spanning nine product lines and seven regions
- The organization had no centralized commercial organization despite increasing reliance on cross-regional and cross-product line projects
- Lack of consistent processes, policies and organizations
- Existing commercial organizations relied heavily on a select number of ‘heroes’ with a wide range of local organizational maturity
- The organization was losing market share at the same time as continued price deflation for their products and services

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone assessed the maturity level of each existing commercial organization
- Activities levels were reviewed against organizational maturity to determine delegation of authority, commercial organization skill requirements, and time demands
- Key commercial roles were developed and rationalized and organizational structures developed to support individual organizations and a Commercial CoE was established
- Process maps, operating rhythms, and role and responsibility mappings were developed to train the business in the new commercial operating model


#### Leading With Results
- **Identified and addressed underserved markets** and product lines helping to drive an 8% increase of revenue in the proceeding 9 months
- **Developed the approach for “Critical Win”** projects leading to dominant market share in several key countries where previous challenges existed
