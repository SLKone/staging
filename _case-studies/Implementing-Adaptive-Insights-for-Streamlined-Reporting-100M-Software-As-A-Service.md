#### Situation
- The client was several months into a software implementation project for their FP&A function, but had failed to meet numerous deliverable deadlines causing the project to veer off course and be delayed by several months
- Success of this was dependent upon coordinating between several technical teams, but due to numerous other commitments and a lack of proper prioritization the client had neglected this coordination
- SLKone was engaged in order to assess and ensure that the implementation was delivered successfully and on time. At point of engagement, only 60 hours remained in the implementation budget of 330 hours

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone was able to bridge the gap between FP&A, Accounting, Sales, and the Vendor to make up for missed deadlines and billable hourly overages from the Vendor
- In order to correct prior project mismanagement, a phased approach was implemented to ensure the highest priority items were completed first, while others were moved out 
- SLKone worked with stakeholders and developed custom datasets to feed models in the new software
- SLKone redesigned their level structure to expand the softwareâ€™s capability for budgeting at the most granular business level of Subsidiary, Product Line, and Function

#### Leading With Results
- **SLKone corrected and implemented** a new FP&A reporting SW, which was months delayed and running extremely high on billed vendor hours **without any additional cost to the client**
- The client now has a platform, which **consolidates** and **automates** all monthly **reporting, saving tens of hours each month** for the FP&A team
- Furthermore, the client was able to move their entire **bottoms-up budget process within Adaptive**, bringing complete visibility across their business and creating **one source of truth** for all financials
