 - Account management and dispatch/ coordination team relied heavily on tribal knowledge and ad hoc / unique processes across customers​
 - Organizational structure didn’t support the integration of the newly merged businesses​
 - **SLKone was asked to identify opportunities for cost reduction in the work order management process and design an organizational structure to support the business**

 -  Built work order management “playbook”; standardized process, activities, roles and responsibilities, supporting systems, and metrics​
 -  Codified systems requirements and built operational dashboards to support new process; served as PMO for implementation

#### Leading With Results
