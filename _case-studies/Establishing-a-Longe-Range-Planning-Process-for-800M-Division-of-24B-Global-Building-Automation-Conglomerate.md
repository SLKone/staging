#### Situation
- An $800M division of a $24B publicly traded Building Automation Products company had undergone leadership change to reset the business growth trajectory
- Primary objectives were to drive growth in stagnant business, reduce bloated costs, and reposition innovation and technology leadership
- Long-Range-Planning traditionally was a top-down process with no defined accountabilities
- Lines of responsibility were blurred due to complex matrix structure within the parent company
- SLKone was hired to establish, manage, and deliver a consolidated LRP

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Developed standardized templates that were distributed to all key players; templates used underlying detail to quantitatively roll-up to a 6-line Profit & Loss
- Designed qualitative input templates to identify key drivers of the global business at regional level as well as potential risks and opportunities 
- Worked iteratively with key players to understand and validate projections for credibility and robustness with risks and opportunities identified
- Developed a dynamic consolidation model that allowed management to adjust key drivers and determine their global impact

#### Leading With Results
- **Designed and orchestrated LRP process.** Developed  a template to facilitate initial submissions by Regional and Functional Finance Leaders. Led working sessions to guide creation, consolidated individual submissions
- **Alignment of Strategic Goals.** Independent review of individual and consolidated 5-year plan.  Reviewed alignment to new management's strategic goals; support the revision process as appropriate
- **Provided ongoing support during carve-out of division.**  Final LRP was used during diligence to support the business case to bidders.  Facilitated all diligence related requests to future projections
