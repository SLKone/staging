#### Situation
- A private equity portfolio company had a limited line of sight of future cashflows & large cash commitments
- The Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) process was highly manual and had inadequate visibility, resulting in slow collections (DSO 50+ days)
- Management was expecting negative liquidity by the end of the month after exhausting their revolver facility
- The accounting team lacked fundamental skills to close the month, complete treasury tasks, and reconcile balance sheet accounts

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Enhanced the 13-week cashflow forecast model and coordinated the capture of all cash outlays
- Develop an RCM dashboard to enhance visibility of key opportunities to reduce DSO by payor and center
- Setup a cash disbursement process to stretch non-critical spend
- Worked with key suppliers to extend payments
- Enhanced reconciliation process, balance sheet review, development of accounting team, and treasury function

#### Leading With Results
- **Generated 6.3x higher liquidity** than expected as a result of a controlled cash disbursement process and the implementation of a vehicle lease program
- **Improved collections forecast accuracy to +/-3%** from the analytics performed on payor payment profiles
- **Corrected key balance sheet accounts** after reviewing several fiscal years of transactions and completing updated reconciliations
- **Enhanced visibility of collection progress** using an RCM dashboard triggering corrective actions by payor/center (=> DSO 38 days)
- **Evaluated the banking relationship** to facilitate a new clearing house and automated RCM process
