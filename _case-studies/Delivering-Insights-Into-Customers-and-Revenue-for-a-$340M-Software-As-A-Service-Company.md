#### Situation
- The client had no visibility to their Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Customer install base; a vital metric to understand the health of a SAAS business
- Finance leadership had pressed internal resources over the course of 9 months to provide insights into this, and other metrics, to no avail
- Due to a combination of resource and perceived data constraints, there had been no successful attempts to identify these metrics
- SLKone was engaged to fill this gap in understanding, and derive an ARR waterfall calculation (including install base), as well as several other key SAAS metrics

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone researched the available client data and interviewed several internal teams which resulted in successfully calculating an ARR install base and, subsequently, ARR and Customer base waterfall
- In addition, SLKone was able to calculate other relevant metrics including: CAC, ACL, CLTV, and more
- To convey these metrics readily-accessible workbooks were created to allow for quick and accurate updates
- Analysis was performed for the proceeding six quarters to supplement the metrics with historical performance trending

#### Leading With Results
- **KPIs** which had not existed previously and thought unobtainable **were identified, calculated, and presented over the course of several weeks**
- **Sustainable and easily updatable workbooks** were delivered to **provide insights** into this month, or over the prior 6 quarters trending
- **Valuable insight** was provided to the client as **fundamental** revenue and customer **metrics were quantified**, which **prior to their engagement with SLKone had not existed**
