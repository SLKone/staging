#### Situation
- The client had relied on an internally created, MS Access, based system to support operations and planning, utilizing a disparate system for Financial reporting
- Prior to opening a second facility the management team selected an integrated system and implementation partner
- After triple the quoted implementation time and double the budget, the system had yet to be fully implemented and legacy systems were still being used for day-to-day operations
- SLKone was engaged to perform an assessment of the system capabilities, the implementation and develop a corrective action plan

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone performed research and solicited expert advice from our network to review the capabilities of the system to the business needs, in addition the implementation process was root caused
- It was determined that while finance drove the implementation process, a lack of systems knowledge and participation from operations led to several weaknesses in terms of configuration and capability understanding
- In addition, poor project management from the implementation partner contributed to a lack of business understanding and system development

#### Leading With Results
- A summary assessment of **business-system compatibility, configuration and training** was provided
- In addition, **a corrective plan of action was developed** and the implementation **partner was re-engaged to complete the implementation** and correct configuration issues
