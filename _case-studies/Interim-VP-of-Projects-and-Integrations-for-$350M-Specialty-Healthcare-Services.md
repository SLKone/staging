#### Situation
- Large-scale project work across the organization was above the skillset of the project management organization leadership​
- Multiple large acquisitions had recently been completed but had not been integrated due to a lack of experience and skillset​
- Standard processes and approaches did not exist for managing projects or integrations​
- Strategic priorities for the upcoming year were anticipated to include over six enterprise-wide projects and three large acquisitions

#### Bespoke Solutions

- Developed standardized approaches and templates for the intake and ongoing management of projects for the organization​
- Developed standardized processes and management tools for the acquisition to integration lifecycle for all functions​

- **Standard organization approach.**  Standardized approaches were developed to enable hiring of resources to drive projects on an ongoing basis, including hiring of key roles​
- **Integrations enabled step-wise growth.**  The integration management processes developed enabled step-wise growth of the organization and approach for future acquisitions to continue
