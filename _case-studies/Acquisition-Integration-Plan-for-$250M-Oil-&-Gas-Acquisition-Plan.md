#### Situation
- The client was in the final stages of finalizing a new acquisition which was intended to fill a number of portfolio gaps as well as introduce new commercial capabilities​
- Managers were aware that traditionally with acquisitions through the integration process, the business many times broke apart the acquired business and in doing so likely destroyed value​
- **SLKone was hired to design, review and facilitate a decision-making process to create a strategic integration plan**

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone reviewed both the Long Range Strategic Plans for the acquirer and target business to identify key differentiators​
- People, organizational structures, Process and Tools were evaluated for their contribution to key differentiators as areas to protect​
- From this insight a range of  integration scenarios were developed and reviewed through financial and organization Key Process Indicators (KPIs) as well as Pros, Cons, Risks & Opportunities

#### Leading With Results
- Provided a destination and integration pathway to follow.  Where the business had a rough integration plan developed, we were able to establish a detailed integration plan for the business leaders to follow to reach that goal.​
- Communication materials developed.  **The process that was executed to review future state provided business rationale and materials to help establish buy in with the acquired business' leadership team on the combined direction.**
