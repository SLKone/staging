#### Situation
- The client was a $80M manufacturer of patio furniture
- Company had leases expiring at two of their primary distribution centers (California and Texas)
- In response, the management team looked to review their footprint to determine lower cost options with a focus on reducing transportation costs to customer


#### Bespoke Solutions
- Conducted a node analysis that identified customer location concentrations after collecting and compiling shipment data to determine customer locations
- Gathered data in key areas of personnel cost, i.e. utility rates, lease rates, and headcount costs
- Developed a model that projected shipments next year to each of their customer locations.  This was used to determine distribution centers
- Ran scenario analyses to evaluate combining multiple distribution centers, ability to close expensive centers, and build potential locations

#### Leading With Results
- **Completed scenario planning review** of the various possibilities across lead time, facility costs, and distribution costs, identifying critical improvement opportunities and prioritized by timing and feasibility to complete with the management team
- **Reduced operating expenses by $1.2M annually** (i.e. Salaries, Utilities, and Rent), while increasing warehouse capacity through the consolidation of several facilities into a lower cost state
- **Reduction in average lead time to 1.8 days**, from 3.2 days, to customers through operational improvements
- **Avoided Supply Chain disruptions** with diversified ports of entry
