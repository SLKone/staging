#### Situation
- The region had consistently posted healthy revenue gains over the past three years across each of their 5 primary markets
- Despite increasing revenue trends the region struggled to maintain profitability, negative or just above breakeven margins as well as low relative ROA and ROI metrics
- In response the leadership team implemented a strategic focus to improve the quality of revenue, optimize headcount, improve the balance sheet and understand risks
- The organization lacked a consolidated reporting platform to support these key initiatives and needed a reporting dashboard

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Began by reviewing key data sources and producing a variety of simple and advanced analytics focused on the regionâ€™s strategic imperatives
- The team facilitated work sessions with the leadership teams to identify the most pertinent analysis and develop an algorithm to report overall progress by market
- In partnership with an IT developer, a dashboard was created and integrated to the base systems utilizing Tableau and later converted to Spot Fire

#### Leading With Results
- **15 point YoY increase in profitability** because of reductions in product and customer complexity
- **5% headcount reduction** within management tiers while growing the top line
- **Reduced net working capital from $900M to $500M** in the first 6 months
