#### Situation
- The client was an industry leading manufacturer in the building products space, which sold through a network of individual distributors
- The national network of distributors did not have a standard set of guidelines for their approach
- A formal method to evaluate the performance of the distributors, including appropriate metrics and reporting, did not exist for the sales leadership team

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Conducted field interviews with 17 distributors to identify the top qualitative factors influencing success
- Developed a formal dashboard and reporting tool to review the quantitative performance of all of the distributors
- Crafted a management reporting scorecard to facilitate performance discussions with the distributors
- Developed a “playbook” of guidelines and best practices to improve the performance of existing distributors and leverage guidelines for new distributors, as appropriate

#### Leading With Results
- **Developed a distributor wide performance reporting tool** to track performance of the independent distributors and successfully integrated the reporting into the Client’s systems
- **Established clear expectations and metrics for measuring success** with the increased clarity from a common language
- **Created a common understanding** throughout the organization when the playbook was presented at the annual sales meeting
- **Drove performance** of the business by upgrading underperforming distributors with new distributors in key markets
