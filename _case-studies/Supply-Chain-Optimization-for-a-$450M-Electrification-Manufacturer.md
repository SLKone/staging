#### Situation
- $400M electrification and power manufacturing organization wanted to de-risk and reduce complexity of supply chain with a customer-centric focus​
- Long lead times, parts shortages, and cross-hemisphere shipments yielding excessive freight charges and disrupting business continuity​
- Customers looking for manufacturing capabilities in the Western Hemisphere, resiliency and reduced lead times​
- Lacked a supply chain strategy; immature Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) process​
- Significant New Product Introduction (NPI) underway; organization needed to understand key decisions making criteria

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Created a decision tree that aligns decisions with benefits, risks, considerations and criteria​
- Modeled global supply chain footprint and lanes across manufacturing, sourcing, and distribution​
- Engaged cross-functionally with key stakeholders to understand Voice of Customer (VoC) and operational challenges​
- Identified key sourcing/manufacturing pain points and bottlenecks ​
- Facilitated supply chain strategy development​
- Developed short-to-medium term implementation plan and risk analysis to support strategic initiatives​

#### Leading With Results
- **Modeled key manufacturing bottleneck**; identified opportunities and developed business case for short-to-medium term decisions supporting NPI targets​
- **Identified 1% in gross profit margin opportunity** leveraging tariff arbitrage; profitably transitioned manufacturing to Western Hemisphere **reducing lead times by 30-50%**
