#### Situation
- The client was a $10B oil and gas company, spanning nine product lines and seven regions
- A matrix organization had fluctuated in intensity from products to regions and back to products
- The resulting confusion led to low standardization of roles or organizational structure
- This limited visibility to career paths, the hindered skill set development, and caused extreme variation in performance
- Financial and operational performance metrics had been deteriorating over the past 6 months and the management team identified a need for greater standardization within the organization

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone was engaged to review and assess key product line, regional, and functional organizations
- Initial assessments indicated the existence of more than 1,500 unique roles across the business as well as numerous gaps in key positions
- Lacking guidance, groups developed poorly defined roles and inefficient organizations with excessive layers and low spans of control
- Collaborating with the leaders of both product lines and regions, the team established guiding principles for delineating activities across organizations
- Standardized role guidance was developed with some adaptation points across the organization

#### Leading With Results
- **Implemented standardized roles and organization structures** across the global organization within 5 months, including role definitions, FAQs, and communication plans
- **Achieved annual organization savings of $24M** by consolidating layers and eliminating organizational design inefficiencies
- **Provided clear career paths**, a dynamic organization structure, **removed redundant activities, and identified key resource gaps**
