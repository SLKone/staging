#### Situation
- A recent acquisition by a leader private-equity group for the specialty company resulted in a void in the Office of the CFO​
- The finance function was immature from the previous founder-led group and needed a complete overhaul​
- Additional target companies would need to be integrated and an approach developed to leverage the process​
- As the Company conducted a search for a full-time CFO, an interim CFO, supported by surge resources was identified as an enabling approach

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone deployed a small team of focused resources to fulfill the needs of the Office of the CFO​
- A full-time, interim CFO was sourced and placed to lead the finance function​
- Specialist resources were deployed to support key activities including: budgeting, cash flow modeling, and dashboard and metric creation

#### Leading With Results
- **Stood up the finance function.** Through the interim resources, a functioning office of the CFO was developed including routine, scalable processes to enable future growth.​
- Transitioned to a full-time, in-house resource. After assuming the CFO position for 12-months, a successful candidate was hired to fulfill the full-time role. SLKone conducted knowledge transfer and training to fully hand-off the responsibilities.
