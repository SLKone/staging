#### Situation
- The client was a $200M women’s healthcare company
- The company had grown rapidly in the prior two years, primarily through acquisitions
- The company had a decentralized Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) function and did not leverage reporting and business intelligence
- RCM managed on an exception basis with one-off queries/requests for more data
- SLKone was asked to help define and create a series of management-level RCM reports and analytics

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Met with key stakeholders and identified RCM Reporting Requirements
- Consulted with IT Team to understand what data is currently available and identify gaps in current-state reporting
- Created mock-up dashboards and reports and elicited feedback from key stakeholders
- Transitioned reports into Tableau dashboards that can be accessed across the organization

#### Leading With Results
- **Created and transitioned over ten dashboards** to the company
- **Drove a new data-driven approach** to RCM
- **Accelerated and improved** the decision-making process
- **Improved** visibility of KPI’s
- **Achieved double-digit growth** in utilization of most reports in 1Q19
- **Significantly shortened** the turnaround time for ad-hoc analyses and/or requests as the underlying data is now readily available
- **Improved executive team performance** during Operations Reviews by improved ability to explain operational drivers of financial performance
