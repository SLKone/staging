Phil Lynch is a founding partner of SLKone and currently serves as the Chief Operating Officer.  

Phil has a background in identifying and delivering continuous improvement initiatives for a wide range of companies and industries. He would refer to himself as a generalist or “athlete” when it comes to the problem solving and consulting world. Phil’s diverse background brings unique perspectives to his clients’ most critical challenges while being able to quickly grasp an understanding of the business and industry. 

His specialty areas include: Lean and Continuous Improvement, Operations, Manufacturing, Distribution & Logistics, Salesforce Effectiveness and Performance, Organizational Design and Change Management, Mergers and Integrations, and Finance. 

As COO of SLKone, Phil oversees Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal / Risk / Compliance, and the inner-workings of SLKone. Phil’s keen focus on attention to detail lends well to these responsibilities. 

Outside of work, Phil is active in the community. He has served on boards of directors for numerous non-profits, advised NGOs around the world, maintains an active connection with Notre Dame (his MBA alma mater), and is a volunteer skilled supervisor with Habitat for Humanity of Atlanta. Phil’s hobbies involve working with his hands and he can generally be found working in his garage on the weekends (if not on a jobsite for Habitat). 

Phil has a BSBA from Northern Arizona University in Finance and Computer Information Systems as well as an MBA from the University of Notre Dame.
