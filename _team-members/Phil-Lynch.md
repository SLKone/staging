Phil has a background in identifying and delivering continuous improvement initiatives for a wide range of companies and industries.

His specialty areas include: Lean and Continuous Improvement, Operations, Manufacturing, Distribution & Logistics, Salesforce Effectiveness and Performance, Organizational Design and Change Management, Mergers and Integrations, and Finance. 

As COO of SLKone, Phil oversees Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal / Risk / Compliance, and the inner-workings of SLKone. Phil’s keen focus on attention to detail lends well to these responsibilities. 

Outside of work, Phil is active in the community. He has served on boards of directors for numerous non-profits, advised NGOs around the world, maintains an active connection with Notre Dame (his MBA alma mater), and is a volunteer skilled supervisor with Habitat for Humanity of Atlanta.
