#### Situation
- The client was a large research nonprofit with a large portfolio of technology investments targeting a specific space
- Poor availability of information related to investment status and outcomes
- Lack of information sharing lead to repeated testing of the same sets of hypotheses


#### Bespoke Solutions
- Created a documentation framework to clearly define purpose, desired outcomes of investments, and the projects’ place in the technology landscape
- Implemented processes to intake reporting and status updates in a consistent manner
- Developed reporting templates and a supporting process to disseminate gathered information and knowledge
- Assessed the inventory of knowledge to find compatibilities, opportunities for integration, and points of distinction

#### Leading With Results
- **Leveraged investments, created collaboration, and identified project synergies** by removing information silos in the data and environment
- **5 year project and funding expansion** from the initial scope of work based on exceeding result performance.  The developed frameworks lead to results based funding and clear paths for innovations to become commercialized products
- **Partnership identification and evaluation** through the combined business intelligence with technology frameworks
