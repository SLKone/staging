#### Situation
- Two large oil & gas companies merged into a single publicly-traded industry leader
- The HR records at both companies were outdated and used inconsistent nomenclature for roles & titles across regions and product lines
- Efforts were in progress (but not in affect during the engagement) to standardize and synchronize the merged records

#### Bespoke Solutions

- Identified high impact areas for potential consolidation of reporting lines as well as address excessive management reporting layers
- Additionally, opportunities to standardize job titles and structural gaps were identified

#### Leading With Results
- **Visualized** the HR records into a **clear organizational chart** that was not previously available to the company
- **Presented recommendations** to the Chief of HR and key staff with the intention to assist in operationalizing redistributions and reductions
- **Summarized impact of recommendations** for use in business case
- **Highlighted** necessity to standardize roles and business organizational standards
