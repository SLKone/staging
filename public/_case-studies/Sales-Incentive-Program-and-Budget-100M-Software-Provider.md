#### Situation
- The client had previously leveraged a complicated sales incentive program without documented or enforced standards
- The approach with “exceptions as the norm” resulted in numerous errors and omissions when calculating sales commissions
- The sales organization lacked trust in the commission calculations and payments resulting in a demoralized sales team

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone reviewed the previous model for sales commissions calculations and identified primary breakpoints
- Prior quarter sales commissions were reviewed and corrected, ensuring commissions were paid appropriately
- A new sales incentive plan was designed to reduce complexity, clarify targets and metrics, and ensure transparency in calculations
- An integrated sales commission calculator and payout model was developed to support the current organization and future-growth

#### Leading With Results
- **Sales model developed and implemented** across the organization to track $100M in sales for the upcoming year
- **Developed and rolled out sales targets** for 33 sales individuals across the enterprise
- **New commission contracts and participation agreements** were executed for the sales team
- **Improved clarity in sales commission process** with improved transparency and designed compensation structure **boosted team moral** and lead to increased job satisfaction
- **Realigned employee and company goals** as both were incentivized in a similar manner
